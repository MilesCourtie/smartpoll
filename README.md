# Smartpoll

Smartpoll makes it easy to build your own multithreaded executor for async Rust, by providing a [`Task`](https://docs.rs/smartpoll/latest/smartpoll/struct.Task.html) abstraction that simplifies polling Rust's [futures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html).

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/smartpoll/latest/smartpoll/) for more information.
